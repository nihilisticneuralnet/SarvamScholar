# SarvamScholar
### *Your Course Content Copilot: Because Teaching Shouldnâ€™t Feel Like Rocket Science!*

This project accelerates course creation by providing AI-powered copilots for translating content, generating voiceovers. By integrating Sarvam and Gemini APIs, it simplifies translation, TTS, and lecture generation, reducing the time to create high-quality online courses. GenAI excels at content generation, personalizing modules, and refining educational experiences through rapid, scalable, and production-grade outputs, making it the ideal solution for this challenge.
