# SarvamScholar: Course Creation Co-Pilot

### *Your Course Creation Co-Pilot: Because Teaching Shouldnâ€™t Feel Like Rocket Science!*

This project accelerates course creation by providing AI-powered copilots for translating content, generating voiceovers. By integrating Sarvam and Gemini APIs, it simplifies translation, TTS, and lecture generation, modifying (adding/removing) course outlines, along with quiz, ppt, notes generation (related to the course module), reducing the time to create high-quality online courses. GenAI excels at content generation, personalizing modules, and refining educational experiences through rapid, scalable, and production-grade outputs, making it the ideal solution for this challenge.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Run `git clone https://github.com/nihilisticneuralnet/SarvamScholar.git` to clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages by running `cd <repository-directory>` followed by `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: In the `.env` file in the project root directory and insert your Gemini and Sarvam API keys as follows:
   ```plaintext
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
   SARVAM_API_KEY=<your-sarvam-api-key>
   ```
   Replace `<your-gemini-api-key>` and `<your-sarvam-api-key>` with your actual API keys.

4. **Run the Application**: Finally, run the application using Streamlit by executing `python -m streamlit run app.py`.

Ensure you have all the necessary libraries installed before running these commands.

- AI Avatar: Integrate AI Avatar (which can act as an instructor for the course) using '[DreamTalk](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/dreamtalk/tree/main)'

- Image Generation: Use VertexAI (Imagen) for image generation
  
- Video Generation: Generate Video for each module using [AnimateLCM](https://huggingface.co/wangfuyun/AnimateLCM)

- Languages: For prototype purposes, I have only written the code for Hindi language. Bring more languages into the code

- Prompt-Tuning: For further optimization of LLM responses

- Additional Inputs: Take input as Pdf or a Youtube link and parse it for specific content generation

- RAG: Implement RAG model to verify the content generated accuracy
